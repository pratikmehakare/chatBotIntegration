A simple, responsive chatbot built using React and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates a client-side chatbot with a user-friendly interface, complete with basic functionality such as message exchange, a chatbot button, and dynamic content based on user input.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat**: A simulated chatbot that responds to user input with preset replies.
- **Message Handling**: Sends messages from the user and receives responses from the bot.
- **Smooth Animations**: Animations for the chatbot button and message transitions.
- **Close/Minimize Button**: Ability to toggle the chatbot window with a close icon.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling to create a responsive, modern UI.
- **Framer Motion**: For adding animations to the UI elements.
